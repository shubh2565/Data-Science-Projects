This project is about exploring the time series, analysing them and predicting the time series (forecasting) using appropriate models. It contains:

* plotting the time series
* decomposing the time series into its components
* simple moving average
* simple exponential smoothing
* Holt's exponential smoothing
* Holt-Winter exponential smoothing
* Ljung-Box test
* understanding autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation correlogram
* differencing a time series
* ARIMA and ARMA models
